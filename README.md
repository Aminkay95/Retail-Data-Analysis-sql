This is a project where I used SQL to analyze retail data. I used SQL to do the following:
1) Data Cleaning
2) Data Checks
3) Data Analysis to answer the following business questions:
     1) What are the sales trends like which day of the week and month of the year does the store get most sales?
     2) Who are the frequent customers?
     3) What customers spend the most?
     4) How often customers make repeat purchases?
     5) What is the average basket value of a transaction?
     6) What are the products that get sold the most and the least?
     7) What countries are the most customers come from and what countries spend the most per customer?
     8) What products do the customers who spend the most buy?
     9) what hour of the day does the store see the most traffic?
